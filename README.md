# UIKonfHeads

Memorizing code is easier for me than assigning names to photos or faces of people, so I've created a little game for the upcoming [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com) conference: guess which name corresponds to a person attending the upcoming UIKonf 2013. Bear with me this is a small APP created on one afternoon (with the help of some code used in [QuizDeluxe](http://www.quizdeluxe.de). You can twitter your "Heads Index" or to any person listed.

## Installation & Usage

Download the repository, open up2date XCode, compile and run on your device (iOS 5+). The APP currently loads a JSON info file from my server once a day with a list of attendees (name, twitter-account), finally it loads images from their respective image owners to be displayed within the APP. [AFNetworking](https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking) is used for JSON and image downloading.
